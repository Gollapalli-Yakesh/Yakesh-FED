      <h2>Yuvi's Youth career</h2>
      <p>
        Yuvraj began his career with Punjab Under-16s at the age of 13 years and
        11 months in November of the 1995–96 season against Jammu and
        Kashmir-16s. In 1996–97, Yuvraj was promoted to Punjab Under-19s and
        scored 137 not out against Himachal Pradesh Under-19s
      </p>
      <h2>International breakthrough</h2>
      <p>
        Yuvraj was selected in the Indian squad for the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy
        on the back of his impressive performances for the Under-19 team. He
        made his international debut against Kenya in the pre-quarterfinal. He
        bowled four overs conceding 16 runs but did not get to bat. In the
        quarterfinal match against Australia, Yuvraj won the man of the match
        for his innings of 84 out of 80 balls, against a pace attack consisting
        of Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, that helped India win
        by 20 runs. In the semifinal against South Africa, he scored 41 and
        picked 1/15. He scored only 18 against New Zealand in the final which
        India lost. The tournament was followed by a tri-series involving India,
        Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Yuvraj scored just 55 runs in five innings at an
        average of 11. Yuvraj averaged 15.50 in the ODI series against the
        touring Zimbabwe side in December 2000 after which he was dropped from
        the team.
