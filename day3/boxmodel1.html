    <h1>Che Guevara</h1>
    <p>
      Ernesto "Che" Guevara (14 June 1928 â€“ 9 October 1967) was an Argentine
      Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat, and
      military theorist.<br> A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized
      visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and
      global insignia in popular culture.

        In 1948, Guevara entered the University of Buenos Aires to study
        medicine. His "hunger to explore the world" led him to intersperse
        his collegiate pursuits with two long introspective journeys that
        fundamentally changed the way he viewed himself and the contemporary
        economic conditions in Latin America. The first expedition, in 1950, was
        a 4,500-kilometer (2,800 mi) solo trip through the rural provinces of
        northern Argentina on a bicycle on which he had installed a small
        engine. Guevara then spent six months working as a nurse at sea on
        Argentina's merchant marine freighters and oil tankers. His second
        expedition, in 1951, was a nine-month, 8,000-kilometer (5,000 mi)
        continental motorcycle trek through part of South America. For the
        latter, he took a year off from his studies to embark with his friend,
        Alberto Granado, with the final goal of spending a few weeks
        volunteering at the San Pablo leper colony in Peru, on the banks of the
        Amazon River.
